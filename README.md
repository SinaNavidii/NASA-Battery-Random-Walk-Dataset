# NASA Random Walk Dataset Preprocessing

This repository contains preprocessing scripts for the **NASA Random Walk Dataset**.

### Methodology

The preprocessing approach follows methodologies proposed in the following papers:

1. **Richardson et al.** (DOI: [10.1016/j.est.2019.03.022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2019.03.022))  
   *"Battery health prediction under generalized conditions using a Gaussian process transition model"*

2. **Wen et al.** (DOI: [10.1109/TIV.2023.3315548](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2023.3315548))  
   *"Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Prognostics and Health Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries"*

### Overview

The preprocessing scripts included in this repository enable the preparation of the NASA Random Walk Dataset for subsequent modeling and analysis. The main tasks performed during preprocessing include:

- **Data cleaning and filtering** 
- **Feature extraction** based on key battery metrics used in each paper.
